This design feature provides a more relaxed and casual look compared to the closed lacing system of oxford shoes. Derby shoes are typically made of high-quality leather, known for its durability and elegance, making them suitable for both formal and casual occasions. With their timeless style and comfortable fit, derby leather shoes are a staple in any well-rounded wardrobe.',
