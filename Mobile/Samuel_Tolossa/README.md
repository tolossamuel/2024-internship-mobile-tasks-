## Implementation Details

### Design Replication

The user interface should closely match the design provided in the Figma link. Focus on:

* **Colors**: Match the color scheme as closely as possible.
* **Layout**: Ensure the layout and positioning of elements are consistent with the design.
* **Typography**: Use the specified fonts, sizes, and weights.
* **Design Elements**: Include any specific design elements such as buttons, icons, and images.
